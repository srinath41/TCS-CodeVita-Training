Circular LinkedList:
A linked list is a linear collection of data elements whose order is not given by their physical placement in
memory. Instead, each element points to the next. It is a data structure consisting of a collection
of nodes which together represent a sequence. In a linked list, each element is a separate object,
known as a node (or link).
Each node contains two items: the data and a reference (or link) to the next node in the sequence.

data field : stores the data of the node
next field : stores the reference to the next node in the sequence

In Circular LinkedList For last node, next field will point to the first node.
