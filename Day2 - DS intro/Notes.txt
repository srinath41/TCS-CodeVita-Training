Data Structures.

Linked List:
A linked list is a linear collection of data elements whose order is not given by their physical placement in
memory. Instead, each element points to the next. It is a data structure consisting of a collection
of nodes which together represent a sequence.
In a linked list, each node contains a value and a reference (or link) to the next
node in the sequence. This structure allows for efficient insertion or removal of elements from any
position in the sequence.

operations on Linked List:
1. Insertion: Inserting a new node at the beginning or end of the list.
2. Deletion: Deleting a node from the list.
3. Search: Searching for a node with a specific value.
4. Traversal: Traversing the list to access all nodes.
5. Sorting: Sorting the list in ascending or descending order.
6. Reversing: Reversing the order of the list.
7. Merging: Merging two linked lists into one.
8. Splitting: Splitting a linked list into two or more lists.
9. Counting: Counting the number of nodes in the list.
