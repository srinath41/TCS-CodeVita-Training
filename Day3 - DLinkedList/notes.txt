Advantages of linked list:
-LinkedList is a dynamic structure.
-We can effectivly use memeory
-self referenced structure.
-insertion can be done at any position.
-deletion can be done at any position.

Disadvantages of linked list:
-Searching is a time consuming process.
-Insertion and deletion is a time consuming process.
-Extra memory is required for storing the address of each node.
-It is difficult to implement a linked list in a multi-threaded environment.


Double LinkedList Notes:
It is a linear data structure in which each element is a separate object, known as a node.
In Double LinkedList, List can be divided into 3 parts.
1) Previous field used store address of  previous node.
2) Data field used to store data.
3) Next field used to store address of next node.

Data flow can both  forward and backward.

class Node{
    int data;
    Node next;
    Node prev;
    public void  Node(int data){
        this.data=data;
        this.next=null;
        this.prev=null;
    }
}

Diagramatic representation of Double LinkedList:
A<->B<->C<->D<->E
A is the head node and E is the tail node.
A previous contains  null and A  next contains B.
A is the previous node of B and B is the next node of A.
E next  contains null and E previous contains D.

operations in LinkedList:
1) Insertion
 insertbegin
 insertend
 insertAt
2) deletion
deletebegin
deleteend
deleteAt
3) search
4) display
5) reverse
6) sort
